# Maze-Solver

Boot.dev course 11 project

ideas to extend the project:
- customizable start and exit
- adjustable sleep_time for animation
- different animation times for new paths and backtracking
- try some other solving algorithms (BFA, A*, ...)
- time and see which algorithm is fasster
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- improve support of large mazes
- make it a game where the user choses directions
- if it's a game, make the user race the algorithm
- make it 3 dimensional
- improve visuals
